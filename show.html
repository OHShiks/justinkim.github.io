         <h3>  <b>Proposal</b></h3>
		<p>
		This is essentially a continuation of my sculpture work Protection (on right image). Just like the previous work, there will be objects that acts like a shell surrounding a bright and “pure” core that will represent the core of a being or thing. The core itself (preferably the size will be 5 or more inches) will be 3D printed in mind to be transparent and hallow internally to allow the installation of LEDs and sounds. The objects surrounding the core will be sharp and angular. They will also be fashioned in a way that their suggested line follows towards or away from the core, depending on the audience’s perspective. Both the layers and core will be hanged individually from the ceiling to give the impression that everything is suspended in mid-air and that the objects are surrounding the core in all directions. </p>
            <p>
This setup is to play with the idea/perspective/mood between outburst and oppression (or explosion or implosion). How <b>external</b> forces or <b>internal</b> struggles suppress down on you and you need to break out of a mold explosively. The LEDs in the core, combined with the suggested lines of the objects surrounding it, will assist in setting the mood of the piece between a positive or negative mood (being attacked/oppressed and breaking out).

             Cornelia Parker relates to my work based on the visual aspects and construction of her work  <i>The Story of Cold Dark Matter</i>. Visually because she too created a mid-explosion and constructively because while creating this work she is constantly mindful not only of the pieces she suspends in midair but also the space in between them. She even makes note of the idea of the explosion too saying, <br><br>
              <i>“As the objects were suspended one by one, they began to lose their aura of death and appeared reanimated, in limbo.  I operate very often in these ‘frozen moments’ where there’s been lots of action but this a sort of quiet corner of that…So it’s not the explosion, it’s more the contemplation, you know, the quiet contemplation of these things in the air and because the things are in the air, they haven’t got the pathos they would have had if they were on the ground. It takes away that kind of pathos, which is there when you see a lot of the debris on the ground after an explosion, well put it back in the air and it’s still got some life.” </i> <br><br>
As such I believe her method of contruction will beneifit myself in constructing my Persistence.

              Do-Ho Suh would relate here based on his with work with <i>Floor</i>. In simplest terms, it can be considered that this work is built from the “one vs many” ideal that came to Suh regarding his identity as a Korean American after the riots that happen in LA. I wanted to do something similar here with Persistence, the idea of one individual (the core) against a collective (the debris) in two situations both visually similar (attack and explosion). The one vs many ideal will help the audience understand that my work is to represent individuality against a collective or social reforms both internally and externally.

            What I take from Sandy Skoglund’s work such as <i>Cold War and Radioactive cats</i> is her use of suggestive and directional lines that all collectively point to a single focal point, yet she does it in a way that the objects that create said lines complement the composition and makes the entire work interesting instead of just the focal point. Suggested lines are going to be an important factor in my work since I’ll need to suggest lines that going both inward and outward motion to portray my “Internal or External” ideal.

          </div>
           
          <div class="six columns">
             Like Cornelia Parker, Damian Ortega’s work with <i>Controller of the Universe</i> also includes a mid-explosion suspended with the use of wire and a theater grid. However, the biggest difference here that I take inspiration from is that the tools that Ortega uses is presented with suggested lines that project outwards. He positioned them this way to, “transform the visitor’s own ideas about what tools are and mean.” I want to construct my project so that the audience will look past the straightforward idea of an explosion and understand that this is also an idea of individuality.

          <h5>Small Scale</h5>
          Since this was going to be a large scale installation in the Black Gallery, creating a small scale version was probably best. While the small scale constructed here doesn't exactly protray the exact presentation of the final work, This was enough to understand the interactions between each piece in their relative placement as well as getting an idea of other elements including lighting (video test below).

                  The first prototypes done were the pieces that would surround and cover the overall area of the work. These piece shown on the left were made with corrugated plastic sheets that were then cutout into trianglar shaped pieceand then warped, bended, and melted using a heat gun. The initial plan was to just use plastic sheets. However, I found that cardboard can also make dyamic edges and textures slighly as well. As such, Several pieces of cardboards will now be added into the mix. I initially stayed away from cardboard since previous experience found that they weren't so mendable without assistance but here they can help with contruction. Several more piece will be made and then they'll be painted with some browns, greys, and some clear finish to give a more warped metal debris.

                  As the core was suppose to represent the an individual while relating to evryone, I went for an overall sphere shaped with several "imperfections" of rising and concaving spots. It is later interized that said spots would help construct the suggested direction based on the elevation of those spots ( high spots for outward direction and the opposite). I printed two halfves of the core with a 3D printer using transparent PLA and made so the inside would be hallow to allow space for the neopixel strips inside. <br>
                   The electronics themselves is simply using a neopixel strip connect to an Ardunio Uno. The videos below show the elecronics using modifiled example sketches and a modiflied sketch generator provided online. They will then be balled up inside the core. For the lighting, I wanted it to presented bright and dark colors to represent a external force or internal force (social mentalilty vs self-realization) but since I wanted to include the shadows I went for the bright classic "good" green and "evil" purple. <br><br>
